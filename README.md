### Setting Up the Virtual Environment

To set up the virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal/command prompt.
2. Run the following command to create a virtual environment named "ML_Projects":

    ```
    python3 -m venv ML_Projects
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - For Linux/Mac:

    ```
    source ./ML_Projects/bin/activate
    ```

    - For Windows:

    ```
    .\ML_Projects\Scripts\activate
    ```

### Installing Project Requirements

After activating the virtual environment, you can install the project requirements using pip. Simply run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
